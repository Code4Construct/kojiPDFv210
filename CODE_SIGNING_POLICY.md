Free code signing provided by SignPath.io, certificate by SignPath Foundation.

## Project

- Project: `kojiPDF`
- Repository: `https://github.com/Code4Construct/kojiPDFv210`

## Team roles

At the current stage of the project, the maintainer [`Code4Construct`](https://github.com/Code4Construct) is responsible for all code-signing-related roles.

- Committers and reviewers: [`Code4Construct`](https://github.com/Code4Construct)
- Approvers: [`Code4Construct`](https://github.com/Code4Construct)

If additional maintainers are added in the future, this section will be updated to keep code-signing responsibilities explicit.

## Signing scope

The project intends to sign only official release artifacts built from the source code and build configuration stored in this repository.

Planned signing targets include:

- `kojiPDF.exe`
- `kojiPDF_Setup_<version>.exe`

Unsigned or manually replaced binaries are not intended to be submitted for signing.

## Privacy policy

This program will not transfer any information to other networked systems unless specifically requested by the user or the person installing or operating it.

## Build origin

Release artifacts are intended to be produced from the repository source and tracked build configuration.  
The project plans to use an automated build process for signed releases so that signed binaries can be traced back to the repository source used to create them.
